; Optionally, uncomment the oAuth2AdditionalScopes line to provide additional
; OAuth2 scopes. The AdWords API OAuth2 scope is always included. For
; additional OAuth2 scopes, reference the OAuth 2.0 Playground
; (https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/). In the playground, each
; application has a list of OAuth2 scopes. For example, you would enter
; https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics here as a value if you would like
; to include Google Analytics as an additional scope.
